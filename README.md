Node Red Flows Storage in Mongo
===============================

This module allows you to store your flows and library entries
in MongoDB.

It's incredibly crude, and slow for large numbers of library entries,
but it does the job for my use case and scale.

Pull requests welcome!

Usage
-----

For this one, you'll need a separate script to start your Node Red,
as per the guide for running a custom Node-Red inside your process:

http://nodered.org/docs/embedding.html

Firstly, require the module:

```bash
npm install --save node-red-flows-mongo
```

Then, in your settings, add:

```javascript
var settings = {
	...
	storageModule: require("node-red-flows-mongo"),
	mongoUrl: 'mongodb://localhost/nodered',
	...
};
```

Your `mongoUrl` could also be an environment variable, with `process.env.MONGO_URL'.
